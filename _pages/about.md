I am a second-year RM/Ph.D. student at the University of Tilburg, Department of Finance. My fields of interest are Industrial Organization, Behavioral Finance, and Applied Microeconometrics. 

I am specifically interested in the learning, expectation formation and decision making processes of economic agents, and any potential biases that might arise during these processes. I believe that quantifying welfare losses associated with such rational and/or irrational attitudes is inherently important for consumers, firms, industries, aggregate economy, and thus policy-makers.
