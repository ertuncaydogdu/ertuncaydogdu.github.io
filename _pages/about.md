I am a second-year RM/PhD student at the University of Tilburg, Department of Finance.

My fields of interest are Indusrial Organization, Behavioral Finance, and Applied Econometrics. I am specifically interested in learning and expectation formation processes of decision makers and any potential biases that might arise during these processes. I believe that quantifying welfare losses originated from any kind of such rational and/or irrational attitudes is inherently important for consumers, firms, industries, and policy-makers.
