I am a second-year RM/Ph.D. student at the University of Tilburg, Department of Finance. My fields of interest are Industrial Organization, Behavioral Finance, and Applied Microeconometrics. 

I am specifically interested in the learning and expectation formation processes of decision makers, and potential biases that might arise during these processes. I believe that quantifying welfare losses originated from any kind of such rational and/or irrational attitudes is inherently important for consumers, firms, industries, and policy-makers.
