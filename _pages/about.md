## About me!

<p style="margin-left: 40px">I am a second-year RM/Ph.D. student at the University of Tilburg, Department of Finance. My fields of interest are Industrial Organization, Applied Microeconomics, and Behavioral Finance. </p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px"> I am specifically interested in the learning, expectation formation and decision-making processes of economic agents, and any potential biases that might arise during these processes. </p>
